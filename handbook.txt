SMCB GENERAL INFORMATION

1. A GLIMPSE INTO THE LIFE OF VENERABLE IGNACIA DEL ESPIRITU SANTO
Biography of Mother Ignacia del Espiritu Santo
1663-1748


Ignacia was baptized IGNACIA DEL ESPIRITU SANTO, a name chosen for her by her parents. Her father. Jusefe luco was a Chinese from Amoy, China while her mother, Maria Geronima from Binondo, Manila was a Filipina or Yndia as the Filipina was called then. As the eldest, she had one brother and two sisters who all died in infancy. Ignacia was baptized on March 4, 1663 at Holy Kings Parian but she grew up at Binondo, Manila the place for converted Chinese.


At the age of 21, her parents wanted her to get married. In her desire to seek and to do God's will, she made a retreat- the "spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola" upon the advice of a Jesuit, Fr. Pablo Clain There in the retreat she decided to give her whole life to God having been enlightened that married life was not for her.


After the retreat, she left her parents who could decently support her, and brought only a needle and a pair of scissors from home. She lived a life of solitude living by the sweat of her brow.


Her life of prayer, sacrifice and charitable works to others attracted many ladies who joined her that brought about the birth of a group of women under her leadership called Beaterio dela Compañia de Jesus in Intramuros. This group received this name because they frequented the Church of St. Ignatius of the Jesuits or the Compañia de Jesus as they were known.


Mother Ignacia's life of prayer and penance included carrying the cross under the noonday sun. She exhorted her companions to prayer for God's mercy and trust always in the Divine Providence


In 1737, Mother Ignacia relinquished her position as head to Mother Dominga del Rosario with the 1726 Rule as guide. This Rule stressed that everyone in the house belonged to the family of Mary in serving God our Lord and in knowing Jesus Christ as necessary for life here on earth and eternal happiness in the next. Everyone was exhorted to live in God's presence always, find Him in all things and to live in one community permeated by the spirit of peace, reconciliation and love.


On September 10, 1748, Mother Ignacia died at the age of 85 years old and was buried at the Church of St. Ignatius. Her funeral was honored by the presence of ecclesiastics and Spaniards who bore her coffin. Murillo Velarde, a Jesuit historian and contemporary of Mother Ignacia has this to say of her.


"Mother Ignacia, foundress of this institution died on September 10, 1748. She was genuinely a valiant woman, overcoming not only the great difficulties met from the very foundation of the institution up to its completion, but more especially for having conquered with singular persistence the three species of indolence most arduous and difficult to overcome: those innate in the country, those natural to her sex, and those congenital in the very entrails of the nation. She was mortified, patient, devout, spiritual, zealous for the good of souls, very humble, this last proved by her having abdicated spontaneously the government allowing herself to be overcome by the of the house, without desire to command, which can be likened to a wood-borer that destroy such hardwoods as the cedar or hyssop”.


 At the time of her death, she had 50 companions who aspired towards the same ideals and goals for which Ignacia herself left home and parents in order to live a life of prayer, sacrifice and service.


At a time when the nature of religious life was in many ways monastic, and therefore protected within convent walls by cloister and grills, the little group of Mother Ignacia added to such convent practices, a life of action and service. In particular, they involved themselves in the retreat movement for women and in the education of the less fortunate of society. The same works continue even today among the more than 70 RVM communities and the more than 600 RVM Sisters all over the Philippines and abroad.


The group that Mother Ignacia started received Civil Protection from the King of Spain on November 25, 1755 after having passed the scrutiny of the Royal Audencia that unanimously rated its service as laudable in the City of Manila. "Mother Ignacia del Espiritu Santo is the genuine product of the nation in the highest order and a fitting model of womanhood" runs an article in the September 7, 1893 issue of the Weekly paper, La Ilustracion Filipina. "She was the foundress of a religious institution that still lives its pristine spirit vigorously two centuries after its foundation"


The congregation she started was described during her time as the "blossoming of virtues and virginity in a thorn-choked desert", Twentieth century Philippines called the Religious of the Virgin Mary, the present name of the Beaterio as citadel of religion and culture and the the re- incarnation of authentic Marian devotion in the Philippines.


Down the centuries, Mother Ignacia del Espiritu Santo was described as a discerning woman of courage, with a strong faith in God that propelled her to make bold initiatives in spite of obstacles to be of service to all people, especially the poor, her very own people and discriminated against, as her contribution to her country and the Church of her times.


2. HISTORY OF ST. MARY’S COLLEGE OF BALIUAG, INC (Revised 2023)


ST. MARY'S COLLEGE OF BALIUAG (SMCB), founded in 1912, is the oldest existing Catholic School in the town of Baliuag, Bulacan. It is owned and administered by the Religious of the Virgin Mary, better known as the RVM Sisters.


This sectarian school began as COLEGIO DE LA SAGRADA FAMILIA or HOLY FAMILY SCHOOL. It was put up by Fr. Benito Sebrero for the Sisters to provide education and religious instruction to young girls and at the same time, to serve as the Catholic school of the parish. Originally located a few blocks from the Catholic church, it acquired its present site through the generosity of Fr. Victor Enrile, then Parish Priest. Its pioneering years in Baliuag were "years of financial crisis, trials and deprivation." It was only Fr. Enrile's fatherly solicitude and Doña Dorotea Francisco's magnanimity encouraged the Sisters to go on. On September 15, 1916 the Archdiocese of Manila, through Rev. Jeremias J. Harty, granted the Religious of the Virgin Mary (then headed by Superior General Mother Ma. Efigenia Alvarez), perpetual and gratuitous use of that parcel of land along what is now known as Racelis Street.


In the beginning, the school offered only a primary course, piano lessons, and catechetical classes. Intermediate classes were opened in 1933. When World War Il broke out, classes were suspended and with the townspeople. Japanese soldiers occupied  the school house until the eve of liberation. In 1945, the sisters hurried back to town and reopened the school. This time, complete elementary and secondary courses were offered. Boys and girls were admitted in the grade school and only girls in the high school. The elementary course was granted government recognition in 1946 and the secondary course in 1949.


The high school tried admitting boys in 1954 but this co-educational experiment lasted only until 1958 because there were other non-sectarian schools in the vicinity that provided secondary education for boys. 


To accommodate the rapidly growing population, S. Ma. Filomena Ariona started the construction of a new building which was finished through the initiative of S. Ma. Geronima Perez. This was blessed on June 30, 1959 by Fr. Amado Paulino, then the Assistant Parish Priest. In the same year, the Holy Family School was renamed ST. MARY'S ACADEMY (SMA).


From 1961 to 1967, SMA achieved an appreciable degree of progress and expansion through the leadership of S. Ma. Fideliz Dar Santos who spearheaded the construction of the annex building. This housed the Sisters' cloister, chapel, interns' dormitory, library, and  science laboratory. The extension of this building was completed by the succeeding Superior-principal, S. Ma. Felisa Declaro. The building housed the principal’s and cashier’s offices and high school classrooms. These improvements spurred an influx of more students. For more effective teacher supervision, academic coordinators were assigned beginning in mid-1970: Ms. Herminia Demetrio for the grade school department and Ms. Ofelia delos Santos for the high school department.


During the administration of S. Ma. Celedonia Amper, a four storey building was constructed along Racelis Street in 1986. This was named St Joseph Building. In school year 1985-1986, at the request of the parents. SMA readmitted boys in the high school department. In 1990, another structure named Mother Ignacia Building was constructed to complete the school front of four-storey buildings, now a landmark in the town of Baliuag. 


In 1994, with S. Ma Luz dela Cruz at the helm, a bilateral building to replace the old grade school building was constructed. Named Assumption Building, it had 28 classrooms, a chapel, a library, an audio-visual room, the guidance and administrative offices. 


In response to the thrust for lay empowerment, the first Lay High School Principal, Mrs, Myrna Bondad, was appointed in June 1995. S. Ma. Lilibeth Monteclaro was also assigned as Grade School Principal. 


S. Ma. Violeta Acosta took over as Directress in school year 1996-1997. She took the initial steps on having the school accredited by the Philippines Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities (PAASCU). Both the grade school and high school departments passed the preliminary visits with flying colors in 1999 and 2000, respectively. In June 1999, Mrs. Elizabeth Chico was appointed the first lay Grade School Principal. Through her leadership, the elementary department passed the first formal visit in September 2000. 


Starting school year 2000-2001, Sma shifted and explored other innovative teaching-learning techniques and introduced the use of strategies that cater to the students’ divergent learning capacities and modalities. The school can claim to be the first in Baliuag to advocate the use of classroom activities based on Howard Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligences and Dunn and Dunn Learning Style Model. 


Beginning school year 2001-2002, S. Ma. Marissa Viri took over as SMA's directress. In October of the same year, the high school department was granted accredited status by PAASCU. 


In March 2002, the school applied for tertiary level programs and was renamed St. Mary's College of Baliuag (SMCB) with S. Ma. Marissa Viri as its first President. The first batch of college students was admitted in the academic year 2002-2003. The following courses were offered: Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA), Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd), and Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd).


On February 28, 2003, a new edifice Sacred Heart Building that would connect St Joseph and Assumption Buildings was inaugurated. This would house the college library, two computer laboratories, speech laboratory, audio-visual room, computer aided instruction (CAI) room, and the college offices. In June 2003, the bridge that now connects the Mother Ignacia and St. Joseph Buildings was completed. The space generated by the bridge provided rooms for the new offices of the high school principal on the third floor and the high school guidance staff on the fourth floor. In the school year 2003-2004, the college department added two more courses: Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) and Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (BSHRM). This same year, the CISCO Program was offered to both BSIT and 3rd to 4th year high school students. The grade school department also started offering nursery classes for three-year old kids.


In September 2003, the grade school department had its first PAASCU re-visit and was granted Five-Year Accredited Status. The following school year, 2004-2005 the high school department was revisited and was also granted a Five-Year Accredited Status. 


The following lay administrators were appointed in school year 2005-2006: Mrs. Myrna Bondad as the Director for Academics and Research (DAR) and Dean of College; Mrs. Elizabeth Chico as the Director for Administrative and Support Services (DASS); Mr. Rogelio dela Peñia Jr. as the High School Principal and Mr. Perfecto Austria as the Grade School Principal,


The first capping and candle-lighting ceremony of the Nursing Program was held on June 7, 2005 and the first college graduation was held on March 19, 2006.


To accommodate the increasing enrollment, an additional five-storey building, the Immaculate Heart Building (IHB), was constructed in November 2005 along Año Street. This was finished and blessed in December 2006. This new building houses the canteen and bookstore on the ground floor while on the second floor up to the fourth floor are for the high school offices, library, classrooms, and two science laboratories. On the fifth floor are the school's auditorium and audio-visual room and a portion of the western end of the roofing was made into a view deck and an elevator was installed. 


In 2007, the college started offering short-term technical vocational courses. BSHRM students were also sent to on-the-job training to Singapore. In 2009, the HRM laboratory underwent a major renovation. 


In June 2008, S. Ma. Marisa Rebosura was appointed as the second President of SMCB. In September 2008, SMCB partnered with Gawad Kalinga (GK) and became the GK Builder's Institute in Bulacan. 


On February 24-25, 2009, the grade school department underwent its PAASCU revisit and was granted Level II Re-Accredited Status. With Mrs. Ma. Clara Sepacio as the new Principal, the high school department underwent its revisit on August 26-27, 2010 and was also granted Level II Re-Accredited Status. 


With the theme, “Rekindling the Spirit,” SMCB celebrated its 100 years in 2012. The celebration highlighted the school's looking back with pride and deep gratitude to the Foundress of the RVM Congregation, Venerable Ignacia Del Espiritu Santo. She started to kindle the fire of FAITH. EXCELLENCE, and SERVICE among the first group of beatas, who in turn, had perpetrated and caused the blaze to spread until our present time. 


By rekindling the spirit of FAITH, SMCB has nurtured among its students a solid belief in Almighty God. 
By rekindling the spirit of EXCELLENCE, SMCB has developed the passion of students to always strive for the best. 
By rekindling the spirit of SERVICE, SMCB has sown the burning desire for the students to be of help to others, especially the poor. 


On December 12, 2012, Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the school celebrated its Centennial Jubilee. On the same day, SMCB was consecrated to our Lady. 


Physical improvement done during the centennial year included the putting up of the school museum and Mother Ignacia cornerstone, renovation of the school facade, expansion of the school chapel. transfer of the Guidance and Testing Center, Registrar and Cashier's offices to the ground floor of Mother Ignacia Building. The high school TLE Laboratory was also refurbished.


St. Mary's College of Baliuag trusting in God's providence, has continued to ignite the three Ignacian core values of faith, excellence and service as it journeys beyond its first 100 years. 


For 2012-2013, the school underwent another major change. With the implementation of an institutionalized management and supervision system, an Integrated Basic Education (IBEd) department was born where there is only one principal, academic coordinators and subject area coordinators for both grade school and high school. For the merged set-up, Mrs. Myrna Bondad was appointed as the first IBEd Principal and Mrs. Ma. Clara Sepacio and Mrs. Gloryfiel Entendez as the HS and GS Academic Coordinators, respectively. Mrs. Marita Fiestada was appointed Dean of College and Head of Administrative and Support Services. The same school year also signaled the implementation of the K to 12 Curriculum in Grades 1 and 7.


In June 2013, air conditioning units were installed in all classrooms and learning centers. With the school's adoption of the GENYO E-Learning Management System to replace the CISCO Program, a new computer laboratory was added for the purpose. A new program, Bachelor of Science in Tourism Management (BSTM). was offered in the college department.


School year 2014-2015 was marked by the following milestones: 1) The PAASCU Resurvey of the IBEd department on October 23-24, 2014 and the eventual granting of another five-year Re-Accredited Status until2019; 2) The granting of ISO 9001:2008 Certificate by TUV Rheinland from May 2015 until May 2018; 3) The Department of Education's (DepEd) granting of the provisionary permit for SMCB's Senior High School Program (SHSP) which was offered beginning SY 2016-2017. Physical improvement included the merging of the Basic Education and College libraries; a satellite canteen and a multi- purpose hall at the Sacred Heart Building: a wellness center and Kid's Care room on the ground floor of Holy Family Building.

Due to the untimely death of S. Ma. Paula Adaoag on September 30, 2016, S. Ma. Celerina Bodiongan was designated as the new school President and Mrs. Myrna Bondad was also appointed as the Executive Vice President.


On March 1, 2017, TUV Rheinland had its second Follow-Up Audit where the audit team concluded that the SMCB “has established and maintained an effective system to ensure compliance with its policies and objectives” and therefore recommended the maintenance of the existing ISO Certification. SY 2017-2018 signals the school’s transitioning to ISO 9001:2015 Standards.


For SY 2017-2018, SMCB was clustered with two other sister schools (SMA Hagonoy and SMA Guagua) under the leadership of one President, S. Ma. Celerina Bodiongan.

Improvements in the physical plant included the MIC’s learning commons with Marian Café, provision of a robust laboratory, ACER Academy for SHS and Business Laboratory for the College. This was also the year when the school adopted a strong health insurance policy for students and personnel. As the global COVID-19 pandemic, With the extended enhanced community quarantine, the administration decided to hold the school’s first online Graduation, Completion and Recognition Day ceremonies on May 8. A Resiliency and Sustainability Plan was prepared and implemented to guide the school in meeting the challenges brought about by the new normal in SY 2020-2021. With face-to-face classes prohibited, digital delivery of instruction and other flexible learning modalities have been utilized.


Moreover, the Parents’ Portal was set up for parents and the school to exchange messages, send and receive important academic-related information and documents about students without having to do face-to-face meetings. The portal also served as a medium for the school to broadcast announcements and reminders. During this time of the pandemic, the safety of everyone, especially the parents and students, was the school’s main concern. Therefore, online enrollment alongside online payment was adopted to provide a better and more accessible enrollment and payment system. August 24, 2020 marked the beginning of classes. This academic year, S. Ma. Anita Tomas, RVM was appointed as Dean of College.


In SY 2021-2022, the institution has established a shared leadership with newly appointed academic leaders in the persons of Mr. Perfecto Austria, Mrs. Jennifer Santos and Mrs. Cecilia Alcantara as the IBED Principal, IBED Academic Coordinator and Head of Administrative and Support Services (HASS) and Quality Management Representative respectively. Also, SY 2021-2022 marked SMCB’s second year of battling Online Distance Learning (ODL.) Despite the current roadblocks brought about by the pandemic, St. Mary’s College of Baliwag, Inc. on its 109th year of existence and trusting in God’s assistance, looked forward with hope to brighter years of delivering Quality Transformative Ignacian Marian Education through Quality Technology Infused Modes of Education (Q TIME) towards the formation of Christ-centered leaders empowered to serve their fellowmen and women and
contribute to the betterment of society.


In SY 2022-2023, St. Mary’s College of Baliwag, Inc. continued to navigate the unprecedented pandemic year with great faith and unified force, facing a myriad of challenges and opportunities along the way. With God’s grace, mercy, and compassion, we emerged a stronger and more resilient community. With every challenge comes opportunity. This year afforded us an opportunity to continue upgrading our technology infrastructure for blended mode of learning
delivery. Amid multiple crises, the academic community stepped up and worked together to make St. Mary’s College of Baliwag a safe and healthy school to ensure continuity of learning and apply the many lessons of this watershed moment in human history. With God’s never- ending love, SMCB, on its 110th year continued to IGNITE Quality Transformative Ignacian Marian Education (QTIME) and SHINE through Flexible Learning Arrangement and Modified Environment (FLAME) which provides students with innovative learning experiences the RVM way.


In SY 2023-2024, we shifted to full face to face classes in December 2023. The following have been accomplished in preparation for full onsite classes: Installation of Wet Standpipe System with automatic fire sprinkler; Gatekeeping and Texting Module, a fully automatic turnstile which provides the perfect solution to eliminate entry of unwanted persons inside the school premises. It automatically sends messages to parents or guardians upon entry and exit. Text blasting capability is in place for faster information dissemination; E- Canteen which is a high technology Payment System using the same RFID card where students and personnel can enjoy the services of the school canteen. Parents, students, and personnel can load money using the same RFID card for payment transactions in the canteen. With its on-screen photo ID security feature, it also protects stolen or lost cards from being used by somebody else except the card owners themselves.


The Physical Facilities Management Development Plan (PFMDP) is also regularly reviewed and periodically updated, thus, identifying critical components which include areas of skilled works/major and minor renovations, continual improvement/ preventive maintenance, technology and equipment, sustainable environment, and infrastructure.


Guided by our vision mission and clear about targets, we pressed on our Ignacian Marian journey despite the odds of the past three years. We have come out of SY 2023-2024 rejuvenated and more deeply committed to serving the people the Lord has entrusted to our care. The previous school years reminded us that even through lean times, our Ignacian Marian spirit would keep us strong. We have been blessed by God in countless ways. We remain steadfast in our work and faithful to the legacy of our Foundress, Mother Ignacia Del Espiritu Santo.


The legacy of Mother Ignacia has empowered us to be creative in dealing with problems that impact on our educational mission. We paused and reset our goals, plans and activities guided by our Ignacian core values of Faith, Excellence, and Service (FES). On our 111th year, we highlight the importance of moving forward together and re-ignite our conviction for Quality Transformative Ignacian Marian Education (QTIME), as we continue to hope, achieve, and grow in our shared journey as the only Catholic school in Baliuag, Bulacan.




3. THE SCHOOL SEAL
  



"AM" stands for "Ave Maria" in praise of our Blessed Mother, the Patroness of the RVM Congregation.


The rays signify the light and wisdom which emanate from the Blessed Virgin Mary.


The sampaguita beneath the book, being the national flower, is symbolic of the RVM being a Filipino Congregation. The stars represent our Lady's many virtues.


At the center of the seal is an open book bearing the Latin inscription "Initium Sapientiae Timor Domini" which in English means, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."


Appropriately, it has become the school's motto for it signifies filial fear, love, awe and profound reverence for the Divine Source of wisdom, grace and life.


IV. THE RVM PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION


RVM PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION


St. Mary’s College of Baliuag adheres to the RVM Philosophy of Education aimed at leading all to the fullness of life in Jesus Christ.


We believe that...


* God is Father who, in abundant love and total graciousness, created humanity and all creation to share His love.


* When humanity chose to live apart from God, in his tender mercy the Father sent His Son Jesus to show humanity the way back to Him to pursue the path of justice, truth and love.


* The Father sent the Holy Spirit to sanctify, inspire, guide and enlighten everyone in following Jesus so that the will of God for the well-being of all may be fulfilled.


* God chose Mary to be the Mother of Jesus, the Son of God and the Mother of the Church. Mary, being the first disciple, journeys with us to fullness of life in Jesus Christ.


We believe that...


* By the example set by Mother Ignacia del Espíritu Santo, the RVM Education proclaims that it is the heart that knows God, who is the source of all wisdom (cf. Prov. 2:6; 9:10; Job 28:20/23; Eccl 2:26; Ps 51:6; James 3:17-18).


* Education is a life-long process whereby human persons grow and develop their potentials in the pursuit of their God- given mission of transforming all things in Jesus Christ.


* Learning is growth for every person to become a witness to faith, excellence and service in varied socio-cultural settings; thus, participate in the transforming experience of life in Jesus Christ.


* The school is where the process of growth is directed towards reverence for creation and persons, which fortifies the spirit of communion.


* The students who are citizens of their times, unique with their own history, capacities and inspiration, have the sacred and the good, the promise and the potential for the actualization of the mission entrusted to them.


* The Teachers are persons committed to the process of becoming whole and to the task of leading others to maturity in Jesus Christ.


* The School Administrators are servant leaders committed to witnessing the Good News and to journey with the academic community in their search for truth, beauty and goodness.


OUR MISSION is FULFILLED when our students:


* understand and accept themselves and others;


* develop their talents in service to family, society and Church;


* think logically and critically and express themselves effectively;


* know clearly what they believe and what they believe in;


* believe and trust in Jesus Christ as their personal Savior;


* love and honor MARY as their MOTHER and Model and Mother Ignacia as their inspiration and intercessor;


* possess social awareness and a sense of responsibility for the common good; and


* maintain physical fitness and mental health, avoiding excesses and abuses.


We believe that success in school means more than good examination results. It means learning how to live as well as how to make a living.

Section 2 The Preschool Curriculum and its Grading System


The Preschool Curriculum includes five (5) learning areas: Language Literacy, Filipino, Mathematics, Physical Education and Health, and Christian Living/Good Manners and Right Conduct (CL/GMRC).


Developmental Domains


Developmental domains refer to specific aspects of growth and changes in children. The major domains of development are physical, cognitive, language, and social-emotional. These developmental domains are unique to kindergarten and can be developed across the Learning Areas. The contents of each developmental domain are defined by learning expectations, as follows:


1. Literacy, Language, and Communication. Learners are expected to develop communicative skills in their first languages. They are expected to develop more positive attitudes toward reading and writing, and to view themselves as effective users and learners of the language. This domain provides opportunities for early literacy learning for self-expression through language using the mother tongue or the child’s first language as a literacy resource.




2. Socio-Emotional Development. Learners are expected to develop emotional skills, basic concepts pertaining to themselves, how to relate well with other people in their immediate environment, demonstrate awareness of one's social identity, and appreciate cultural diversity among the school, community, and other people.


3. Values Development. Learners are expected to demonstrate positive attitudes, self-concept, respect, concern for self and others, behave appropriately in various situations and places, and manifest love for our creator, country, and fellowmen. These learning expectations are to be taught with the integration of Good Manners and Right Conduct (GMRC) as stipulated in Republic Act 11476.


4. Physical Health and Motor Development. Learners are expected to develop both their fine and gross motor skills to be efficient and effective movers when engaging in wholesome physical and health activities. They are also expected to acquire an understanding of good health habits and develop their awareness about the importance of safety and how they protect themselves from harm at home, in school, and in public places.


5. Aesthetic/Creative Development. Learners are expected to develop their aesthetic sense and creative expression through drawing, painting, and manipulative activities. Aesthetic development involves the love and pursuit of beauty in art, music, and movement, and creates opportunities for the creative expression of emotions, thoughts, feelings, and ideas.
